# Predicting-California-Housing-Prices
This machine learning project is about predicting California median house prices for districts across California. The dataset is from 1990. This is a practice project  from a book I'm reading about Machine Learning called "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras &amp; TensorFlow" by Aurelien Geron
